## Validation

- Run nwbinspector and save the JSON report alongside the NWB.
- Expect no critical issues for a successful run.

## QC report

- Sync integrity (drop/duplicate frames, drift over time).
- Pose confidence distributions and missing data.
- Facemap previews and summary stats.
- Per-camera video metadata and anomalies.
